# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
#

# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
#

# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').#

# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
#

# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
#

# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
#

# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
#

# m h  dom mon dow   command
*  *  *  *  *  echo "Hello world"

# Begin Whenever generated tasks for: /home/code-engine-studio/RubyOnRails/2017-spring-time-tracker-website-back/config/schedule.rb
* * * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'cd /home/code-engine-studio/RubyOnRails/2017-spring-time-tracker-website-back && RAILS_ENV=development bundle exec rake report:mailweek --silent'

# End Whenever generated tasks for: /home/code-engine-studio/RubyOnRails/2017-spring-time-tracker-website-back/config/schedule.rb
